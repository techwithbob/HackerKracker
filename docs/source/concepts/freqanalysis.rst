**Frequency Analysis**
=======================
Definition
-----------
In cryptography, frequency analysis is the study of the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext. The method is used as an aid to breaking substitution ciphers. Frequency analysis consists of counting the occurrence of each letter in a text. Frequency analysis is based on the fact that, in any given piece of text, certain letters and combinations of letters occur with varying frequencies. For instance, given a section of English language, letters E, T, A and O are the most common, while letters Z, Q and X are not as frequently used.
