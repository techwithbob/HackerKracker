Definitions Level
-----------------
 
 - *Easy* Level: Player is given easy text to cipher using the Caesar Cipher method with a given alphabet wheel.
 - *Medium* Level: Player is given long text to cipher with extra character with given random Caesar wheel.
 - *Hard* Level: Player is given both a cipher and decipher to solve with a given random Caesar wheel consisting of mixed alphabet and numbers. This level requires a :doc:`freqanalysis` to solve the problem.
 - *IMPOSSIBLE* Level: Player is given a complex cipher and decipher to solve with a given random Caesar wheel using :doc:`freqanalysis` based on quadratic and cubic function calculations. **To complete this level**, *players are required to solve quadratic or cubic functions after the player completes the :doc:`freqanalysis` of the cipher or decipher problem.*
